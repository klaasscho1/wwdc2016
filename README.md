#WWDC 2016 Scholarship app
![](banner.png)

This is the app I submitted to Appleâ€™s WWDC 2016 Scholarship competition. Please keep in mind that this app has been developed in about a week time, so please don't expect the code to be very cleanly written. 

_These were the guidelines set by Apple:_

> Submit any app you have worked on that demonstrates creative use of Apple technologies and runs on an Apple platform. Your submission may be a school project, a project you've built on your own, or an app that is available on the App Store. You will also need to answer an essay question about your coding process and provide proof of enrollment from your school or proof of membership from your STEM organization.

##File structure
There is no structure to be found. The whole thing is practically a mess.

##Technologies used
- 3D Touch
- Live Photos
- Apple Maps
- Core Animation

###3D Touch
I have used 3D Touch thoroughly in my app. I tried using it in a creative way, so I decided to use the amount of pressure of the touch as something that decides how far the transitional animation should progress. An example of this is the `About me` transition, it shows a video of me talking and it shows a new frame of the video each time you press harder, so eventually it forms the video.

###Live Photos
Live Photos is one of the smaller features in my app, but still a fun one I suppose. In the `Media Performances` section I talk about the television programs I appeared in, and I decided to convert parts of these videos into Live Photos so you can get a preview of what the broadcast was like.

###Apple Maps
Apple Maps got a whole section of its own, namely the `My Achievements` part. It shows all of my dearest accomplishments in a nice MKMapView with pins. When you click the pin's callout it shows you the story of my accomplishment and a small photo.

###Core Animation
Core Animation is used throughout the entire app. I'm a huge fan of slick animations so I decided to do my best to get some of them in the app. The animations aren't very complicated, but as a whole they make the app seem a lot nicer.
